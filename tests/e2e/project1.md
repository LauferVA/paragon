**Input Format:** Verbal Description via Email
**Subject:** Daily Menu Formatting Tool Needed ASAP

Hey, the chefs are tired of fighting with Word to print the daily specials. I need a simple script where they can just type the text in a basic file—using simple symbols like `#` for the Dish Name and `*` for the ingredients list—and the tool spits out a perfectly formatted PDF with our logo at the top and the date.

It needs to handle bold text for prices (maybe using `**`?) and it shouldn't crash if they paste in weird characters. Just keep it simple. They type text, they get a PDF. Can you build this?
