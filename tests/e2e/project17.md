**Subject:** Reassembling the Shredder trash

The bad guys put the document through a cross-cut shredder. We have thousands of tiny strips of paper. Each strip only has about 5 letters on it, like "THE Q" or "UICK ".

We know that "THE Q" overlaps with "HE QU" which overlaps with "E QUI".

Can you write a program that takes all these 5-letter strings and graphs them out? I need to find the **single path** that uses every strip exactly once. That should give us the original sentence. Be careful—sometimes common words like "THE" appear twice, so you might get a loop in your graph that you need to resolve.
