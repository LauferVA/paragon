  "title": "Fibonacci Calculator API",
  "description": "A simple web API that calculates Fibonacci numbers efficiently. The service should handle large numbers and provide both iterative and recursive implementations.",
  "target_user": "Developers who need a reliable Fibonacci calculation service for testing, education, or integration into larger applications.",
  "requirements": [
    "Endpoint /fib/{n} returns the nth Fibonacci number",
    "Endpoint /fib/batch accepts array of numbers and returns all results",
    "Support query parameter ?method=iterative|recursive",
    "Include request timing in response",
    "Handle errors gracefully (negative numbers, overflow, etc.)"
  ],
  "must_have_features": [
    "Calculate Fibonacci numbers up to n=1000",
    "Support both GET and POST requests",
    "Return results in JSON format",
    "Include timing information for performance analysis",
    "Provide both iterative and recursive calculation methods"
  ],
  "technical_details": "Stack: Python, FastAPI\nDatabase: None required (stateless service)\nPerformance: Response time < 100ms for n <= 100",
  "constraints": [
    "Response time < 100ms for n <= 100",
    "Must handle negative numbers gracefully",
    "Must prevent integer overflow"
  ]
